2013-05-18: (there are ongoing changes in git, but these are notable features)
	- Various state variable handling that should improve robustness and
	   compatibility with various clients:
		- Improved eventing of state variable changes.

		- Subscription of a new client syncs all available variables.
	- Provide a way to write a logfile with --logfile
	- provide callbacks for user-hooks (scrobbling ? LCD display ?)

	- Support get duration and position of current stream.
	- Support basic commands:

	- When we're finished with the current track, we go back to STOPPED,
	  so that controllers will send us the next song.

	  a controller that supports it :)
